Don't Get Kicked

I have pre-processed the data and our program will use these pre-processed training and test csv files.

For all the classifiers:	

test.csv (original: to get the RefID attribute in the final submission file)

For DecisionTree classifiers, the following files are required in the same folder:

	training_equal_freq.csv
	test_equal_freq.csv

Data cleaning and Preprocessing
----------------------------------------------------------------
I used matlab's automated data import method to convert the given csv files into .mat files 

	test.mat 
	training.mat

Scripts (Run in Matlab)

	clean_data_categorical.m	Converts continuous variables in test.mat and training.mat into discrete variables using 
					equal frequency binning for use with decision trees

					Output is saved as training_equal_freq.csv and test_equal_freq.csv


	clean_data_categorical_interval.m	Converts continuous variables in test.mat and training.mat into discrete variables using 
						equal interval binning for use with decision trees

						Output is saved as training_equal_interval.csv and test_equal_interval.csv

	clean_data_distance.m			Converts categorical variables in test.mat and training.mat into binary variables and performs
						zscore normalization on the numeric variables

						Output is saved as zscoretraining.mat and zscoretest.mat

Python files

	LargeMarginPerceptron.py	Execute as 
						python LargeMarginPerceptron <training_filepath> <test_filepath> <save_filepath> <mode> <num_epochs>
					Inputs
						<training_filepath> is the path to zscoretraining.mat, 
						<test_filepath> is the path to zscoretest.mat
						<save_filepath> is the path and name for the output csv file
						<mode> 0 = all original attributes, 1 = no numeric attributes, 2 = no binary attributes
						<num_epochs> number of times the training dataset is iterated through during the training step
					Outputs
						The program will create a submission csv file, <save_filepath>.csv
						The submission file will start with the characters '# '. Delete these and submit to Kaggle.
	
	NaiveBayes.py	Execute as
						python NaiveBayes.py (requires training.dat and test.dat to be present in the same directory)
					Outputs
						The program will create a submission csv file, submission_bayes.csv
	
	RandomForest.py Execute as
						python RandomForest.py(requires training_equal_freq.csv and test_equal_freq.csv to be present in the same directory)					
					Outputs
						The program will create a submission csv file, submission_final.csv
	
	DecisionTree.py Execute as
						python DecisionTree.py(requires training_equal_freq.csv and test_equal_freq.csv to be present in the same directory)					
					Outputs
						The program will create a submission csv file, submission_final.csv
