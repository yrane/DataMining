8 puzzle Game

Yogesh Rane (yrane2)

​
The   n-­puzzle   is   a   sliding   puzzle   that   consists   of   a   frame   of   numbered   square  tiles   in   random   order   with   one   tile   missing.   The   puzzle   exists   in   multiple   sizes,   particularly   the  15­puzzle   and   the   smaller   8­puzzle.   If   the   size   is   3×3   tiles,   the   puzzle   is   called   the   8­puzzle, and   if   4×4   tiles,   the   puzzle   is   called   the   15­puzzle   named,   respectively,   for   the   number   of   tiles  and   the   number   of   spaces.   The   object   of   the   puzzle   is   to   place   the   tiles   in   order   by   making  sliding   moves   that   use   the   empty   space.
I  have   used   A*   search   algorithm   for   solving   multiple   instances   of   the   8­puzzle   and   have   used  the following heuristics: 
1. Number of misplaced tiles. 
2. Sum of Manhattan distances between every tile's current and desired position. 
3. Gaschnig's heuristic
